    <h1>Float</h1>
    <p>
      The float is not much used these days. The float property specifies
      whether an HTML element should float to the left, right, or not at all.
      HTML Elements next to a floating element will flow around it. Nowadays,
      the most common use for float is to make text float around the image.

    <h3>Examples of float usage</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <img src="./images/boat.webp" alt="boat" height="200" class="left-side" />

      <p>
        A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but
        generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger
        size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.
        Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and
        lakes, or in protected coastal areas.
