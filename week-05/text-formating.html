    <h1>Traditional Czech dish</h1>
    <h2>Pork roast, dumplings, and sauerkraut</h2>

    <p><strong>Roast pork shoulder and sauerkraut with potato dumplings</strong> (Kopytka) are a
        comfort food lover's dream. While it might seem complicated making your
        own dumplings, I promise it's not. <em>I first ran across this recipe when I
            was talking with my mother-in-law Dolores about her mother's plum
            dumplings.</em> We were wondering if they were Czechoslovakian or Polish, and
        when searching for Polish dumplings this video popped up. My mom made
        these dumplings a few times but she typically made them on top of the
        chicken as a chicken and dumpling. I watched the video and thought I can
        make these dumplings and put them on top of a pork shoulder with
        sauerkraut, which is one of my favourite fall dishes.

        I used a sauerkraut recipe I found in a cookbook called
        after watching the author, <b><i>Amanda Feifer's</i></b> Instagram feed @Phicklefoods.
        Her book is really fun and teaches you how to ferment all kinds of things
        like radishes, kimchee, zucchini, and cucumbers. I used a
        simple salt rub for my sauerkraut and added a <span style="background-color: yellow;">teaspoon</span> of red
        pepper flakes, as I like it a little hot.
